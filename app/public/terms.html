      <h2>1. Scope and Acceptance</h2>
      <p>These Terms and Conditions (“Terms”) form part of the contractual relationship (“Agreement”) between you (“User”) and Mimir Global (“Mimir”, “we”, “our” or “us”). By accessing or using Mimir’s Web App, APIs, or any related services (“Services”), you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, you must discontinue use.</p>
